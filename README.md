# üõ†  When Disaster Recovery Becomes Necessary

There have been times in my life when certain "stubborn" servers ‚Äî particularly models like **HP ProLiant** ‚Äî refuse to boot from disks located behind RAID controllers, when configured in **JBOD** mode. In such cases, I'm often forced to rely on alternative boot devices such as an **internal SD card slot** or an **internal USB** port to hold a bootable OS.

However, these solutions are far from ideal. SD cards and USB flash drives are not designed for high write endurance and may fail unexpectedly. When they do ‚Äî and especially if the SD card slot or USB port itself becomes damaged ‚Äî we‚Äôre left with a **completely unbootable server**. This quickly escalates into a **critical disaster scenario**.

There are typically three fallback options for booting such a server:

- Use an **external USB port** (unreliable, especially in rack environments).
- Boot over **PXE (network boot)**.
- Use **virtual media** via iLO (e.g., a virtual CD-ROM mounted through a web interface).

A potential fourth option exists if the motherboard has a free **internal SATA port**, but for the sake of this article, we‚Äôll assume it doesn‚Äôt.

# üßØ Objectives of This Article

This write-up is intended to guide you through **restoring functionality** to such systems **as quickly as possible**, with a focus on disaster recovery scenarios. For servers like HP ProLiant, we'll explore how to leverage **iLO features** such as PXE boot and Virtual Media.

The article is structured into three main parts:

1. **Preparing for Disaster** ‚Äì Prevention is better than cure. We‚Äôll start by discussing how to properly prepare your server so that when failure eventually happens, you‚Äôre ready.
2. **Recovery After Disaster** ‚Äì If your system is already down and unbootable, we‚Äôll walk through steps to enter recovery mode, access critical files (like kernel and initrd), and rebuild a bootable environment.
3. **Boot Strategies** ‚Äì Finally, we‚Äôll cover how to boot the system using PXE and Virtual CD-ROM when all else fails.

# üõ°  Preparing for Disaster

‚ö†Ô∏è  If your system is already unbootable, please skip ahead to the next section: **Recovery After Disaster**.

```
apt-get install grub-pc-bin xorriso grub-common mtools
git clone https://github.com/e1z0/Proxmox_Disaster_Recovery.git
cd Proxmox_Disaster_Recovery
cp /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) ISO/boot/vmlinuz
cp /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) ISO/boot/initrd
cp /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) PXE/boot/vmlinuz
cp /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) PXE/boot/initrd
grub-mkrescue -o proxmox-rescue.iso ~/ISO
```

You now have:

* A **rescue ISO** (for mounting as virtual media in iLO or similar IPMI)
* A **PXE folder** (for booting via TFTP/Netboot)

# üíÄ Recovery After Disaster

If your Proxmox server is unbootable and the internal boot medium is dead:

- Download **[SystemRescueDisk](https://www.system-rescue.org/Download/)**
- **Boot** the server with **SystemRescueDisk.iso** via iLO virtual CD-ROM
- At the bootloader menu, press **Tab** and append kernel parameters: `nofirewall rootpass=1234`
- Once booted, connect via SSH using password 1234 (Because using iLO remote control is... a disaster of its own.)
- Mount your Proxmox root filesystem: `mount /dev/mapper/pve-root /mnt`
- Transfer latest working kernel and initrd files from /boot to another Linux machine via sftp
- On that machine, follow the steps in **Preparing for Disaster** to build the recovery **ISO** or **PXE** boot environment.

## üîß Optional: Chroot into the Installed System

If you need to make repairs or changes within your existing Proxmox installation:

```
mount /dev/sdg1 /mnt/boot   
mount --rbind /dev/ /mnt/dev
mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
mount --rbind /sys/ /mnt/sys
mount ‚Äì-rbind /run/ /mnt/run
chroot /mnt bash
```

You now have access to your live system and can modify configs, reinstall bootloaders, or regenerate initrd.

# üöÄ Boot Strategies

## PXE Boot

You can boot the server using PXE via either:

* tftpd64 on Windows
* dnsmasq on Linux


Here is a sample dnsmasq configuration:
```
port=0
interface=eth0
dhcp-range=10.2.14.0,proxy
dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0
enable-tftp
tftp-root=/srv/tftp
```

Then, copy everything from your PXE/ folder into /srv/tftp.

üí° Important: You must create a config file that matches your server‚Äôs MAC address (formatted for PXELINUX).

For example, if your server's MAC is bc:24:11:89:23:a8, then your config file must be:

```
/srv/tftp/pxelinux.cfg/01-bc-24-11-89-23-a8
```
(PXELINUX uses prefix 01- and replaces : with -.)


## Virtual Media

To use the rescue ISO via virtual media:

- Open your server's iLO interface
- Mount proxmox-rescue.iso as a virtual CD/DVD drive
- You can host the ISO on your local machine using a simple web server:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
Ensure the web server is in the same LAN as your iLO interface for faster performance.
